- Number Types:
int: 4 bytes -> 32 bits, - 2 ^ 31 ~ 2 ^ 31
byte: 1 byte -> 8 bits, - 2 ^ 7 ~ 2 ^ 7 (128)
short: 2 bytes, the short integer types, - 2 ^ 15 ~ 2 ^ 15
long: 8 bytes, the long integer types
double: 8 bytes -> 64 bits, the double-precision floating-point type,  about 15 significant decimal digits
float: 4 bytes, about 7 significant decimal degits
chart: 2 bytes -> 16 bits, The character type, representing code units in the Unicode encoding scheme
boolean: 1 bit, true or false, 0 or 1

Double type is not approprecate for financial calculations. Professional programs need to use the BigDecimal type for calculation

Math.round(<double>): long

BigInteger
BigDecimal

- Defining Constants:
keyword: final
Eg:
public static final int age = 10;

- Arithmetic Operations and Mathematical Functions
(a + b) / c
Devicion works as expected as long as at least one of the members involved is a floating-point number.
Eg:
7.0 / 4 = 1.75
However, if all members are integer, such as 7 / 4, the answer will be an integer too.

Remainder operator
7 % 4 = 3

Math.sqrt(x)
Math.pow(x, y): x ^ y
...
Math.toRadians(x): convert x degrees to to radians
Math.round(x)
Math.ceil(x)
Math.floor(x)
